	<h2>Inspiration</h2>
	<br>
	<p>
	One day, when I was 17 years old, I went to my friend's home a laptop that had no ethernet port.<br>
	I had no idea what the password was, so I checked the sticker on the router, only to find that the last few characters had faded away.<br>
	I went home fustrated that day. A little bit of messing around with netsh wlan in command prompt led me to the export command. <br>
	I realized that Windows 10 used .xml files as network profiles to connect to wifi networks. <br>
	I combined what little knowledge I had of BATCH files and Python at that time to construct a wifi password brute forcer.<br>
	</p>
	<h2>How does it work?</h2>
	<p>A .bat file has a loop that does the following:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Delete the current network profile</li>
		<li>Import the .xml network profile in the same directory</li>
		<li>Attempt to connect to the router</li>
		<li>Ping google.com and store the result in a .txt file</li>
		<li>Run editor.py,which does the following, then store what is printed from the editor.py into another .txt file
			<ol>
				<li>Parse the ping .txt result and print if the connection to google.com was a success</li>
				<li>Parse the .xml network profile for the location of the password</li>
				<li>Modify the password by one character according to a char-set string</li>
			</ol>
		<li>Parse the .txt of the result from editor.py and break the loop if a successful connection was made</li>
	</ol>
